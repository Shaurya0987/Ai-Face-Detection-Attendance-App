Attendex is an AI-powered face detection attendance app built for colleges where:

    - Teachers don’t want to waste time calling names

    - Students don’t want to shout “Present”

    - And technology just wants to show off 😎
    
No paper. No proxies. No drama.

With Attendex, attendance is marked simply by showing your face to the camera.



## User Roles

👨‍🏫 Teacher

- Secure login

- Dashboard to manage classes

- Take attendance using face detection

- View attendance reports (no calculator needed)


🧑‍🎓 Student

- Secure login

- Mark attendance by face scan

- View attendance history

- Less excuses, more accountability 😉
## App Screens

- 🚀 Splash Screen (Attendex welcomes you politely)

- 🔐 Student Login

- 🔐 Teacher Login

- 📊 Teacher Dashboard

- 📋 Student Dashboard

- 📸 Face Detection Screen

(All screens share the same clean, formal UI — because consistency matters.)


## How it Works

    - Teacher opens the app 📱

    - Student shows their face 😁

    - AI detects the face 👀

    - Attendance gets marked automatically ✅

    - Everyone is happy (especially the teacher)

No faces were harmed during attendance.

## Known Limitations

- Identical twins may confuse the AI 👯‍♂️

- Needs proper lighting (faces work better in light than in darkness 🌞)

- Works best when students face the camera (yes, even introverts)


## Future Enhancements

- Face recognition (identify who the student is, not just a face)

- Attendance analytics & charts 📈

- Cloud database integration ☁️

- Mask detection support 😷

- Proxy detection (nice try 👀)

## 🚀 About Me

Hi! 👋
I’m a college student and Flutter developer who believes that technology should solve real problems — especially the boring ones (like attendance 😄).

I enjoy building:

📱 Clean and responsive mobile apps

🤖 AI-powered solutions

🎨 Consistent and professional UIs

🐞 Bug-free apps (after fighting bugs for hours)

This project, Attendex, is my attempt to combine Flutter + AI to create a smarter, faster, and more modern attendance system for colleges.

🧠 What I’m Learning & Using

Flutter & Dart – for cross-platform app development

AI / Face Detection – to automate real-world tasks

UI/UX Design – because apps should look good and work well

Problem Solving – especially keyboard overflow bugs 😅

🎯 Why I Built Attendex

Manual attendance is slow ⏳

Proxy attendance is common 👀

Technology can do better 🚀

So I built Attendex — an AI-based face detection app that makes attendance:

Faster

Smarter

More reliable

🚀 Future Goals

Improve AI accuracy

Build more real-world apps

Learn advanced backend & cloud integration

Become a full-stack mobile app developer

☕ Fun Fact

Most of this project was built:

With coffee ☕

Late nights 🌙

And the phrase: “Why is this widget overflowing?”


## Final Note

If this project made your attendance easier,

give it a star ⭐

If it didn’t…

Please blame the lighting conditions.
